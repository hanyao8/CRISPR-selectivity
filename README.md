# CRISPR-selectivity
Project to investigate targeting selectivity in the CRISPR CAS9 system using mean field models and other algorithms


Models 1,2,3 are mean field models of increasing complexity. Several algorithms were also constructed to compare the results of the mean field models with simulations using real DNA sequence data in human chromosomes. Due to the size of genome data, they are omitted from the folder 'nt_data'.
